## GraphQL

As a developer, I need to inject the data from the local database to the views through the graphQL layer, so I can reuse the front-end pieces from Lyra.

- [[VIZ-158](https://shahcompbio.atlassian.net/browse/VIZ-158)] Setup graphQL server
- [[VIZ-159](https://shahcompbio.atlassian.net/browse/VIZ-159)] Write resolvers for graphQL with Lyra's schema
- [[VIZ-160](https://shahcompbio.atlassian.net/browse/VIZ-160)] Inject front end piece from Lyra into Vega
  - Wrapping redux somewhere in some process?

## Redux

As a developer, I need to be able to inject an independent Redux store (regardless of whether redux is used elsewhere), so I can reuse the front-end pieces from Lyra.
