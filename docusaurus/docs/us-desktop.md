Base features for desktop app

## Select files from computer

As a user, I want to select files from my computer to open for an analysis.

- I want to select multiple types, or multiple files for one type
- I want to make sure they're compatible with dashboard (file type, required columns)
- I want to make sure I'm not adding duplicate files
- I want to delete if I add the wrong file

## Describe metadata for current analysis

As a user, I want to describe what the metadata of the current analysis is, so I can refer back to it later.

- I need to add a title and brief description
- I want to be able to add other metadata (library, sample) as needed
- Analysis ID should be auto-generated, to prevent collision of IDs.

## History of past analyses

As a user, I want to see a summary of all analyses I have opened using this dashboard.

As a user, I want to be able to select one of the analysis in the history, so I don't have to reselect the files for the same analysis.

## Connection to remote instance

As a user, I want to connect to the remote (web-based) instance of the dashboard, so I can view any of their datasets on my local instance.

As a user, I want to upload my current analysis to the remote instance, so I can easily share my data with other collaborators.
