- To create a "base" Electron app that will be used in all desktop dashboards and is easily updatable, starting with Lyra

## Background and strategic fit

With the web-based dashboards (like Montage and Lyra), usage amongst researchers have been slow, partially because there is an intermediate step of asking someone from the viz team to upload their data from them. Setting up their own local instance is slow and not ideal. We basically need a system that will enable people to easily and quickly use our dashboards, but also allow us to quickly port it over to the web as well. We will start by porting Lyra over as an Electron app.
